The background is designed with a gradient effect to look modern and attractive.
A moving conveyor belt is shown using animated stripes.
Packages are generated with random properties like weight, color, and size.
Each package has clear labels written on it in bold fonts for readability.
These labels include package ID, weight, color, size, and assigned bin.
The conveyor carries packages forward until they reach the sensor region.
There are three sensor types: Weight Sensor, Color Sensor, and Size Sensor.
The user can switch between sensors by clicking on the glowing sensor lines.
When a package reaches the sensor, the robotic arm becomes active.
The robotic arm is animated with smooth movement to pick up the package.
It then sorts the package into the correct bin based on the chosen sensor.
For example, in weight mode, bins are divided into “Light” and “Heavy.”
In color mode, bins are grouped as Red, Green, Blue, and Yellow.
In size mode, bins are classified as Small, Medium, and Large.
Each bin keeps a count of how many packages it has received.
This count is displayed clearly near the bins.
The text on the screen uses professional fonts like Segoe UI and Calibri.
This makes the presentation look polished and easy to understand.
Shadows and outlines are added to boxes and text for better visibility.
The simulation runs continuously, generating and sorting new packages.
It is fully interactive — the user can switch sorting modes in real time.
This gives a feel of how an actual industrial system might be controlled.
In summary, this project combines logic, animation, and design to explain a real concept.
